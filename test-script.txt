FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A small, cozy coffee shop on a busy street corner. People walk by with purpose, but inside, time seems to slow down.

SARAH (28), a freelance writer with tired eyes and ink-stained fingers, sits at a corner table. Her laptop is open, but the screen shows a blank document. She stares out the window.

SARAH
(to herself)
Another day, another blank page.

The BARISTA (22), energetic with a warm smile, approaches with a fresh cup of coffee.

BARISTA
On the house. You look like you could use it.

SARAH
(surprised)
Thank you. That's very kind.

BARISTA
Writer's block?

SARAH
Is it that obvious?

BARISTA
I see a lot of writers in here. The blank stare is a dead giveaway.

Sarah laughs for the first time in days.

SARAH
I used to love writing. Now it feels like I'm trying to squeeze water from a stone.

BARISTA
Maybe you're trying too hard. Sometimes the best stories come when we're not looking for them.

The barista walks away, leaving Sarah to contemplate. She closes her laptop and looks around the coffee shop with fresh eyes.

SARAH
(voice-over)
Maybe he's right. Maybe I've been looking in all the wrong places.

Sarah pulls out a notebook and begins to write by hand, inspired by the life around her.

FADE OUT.
