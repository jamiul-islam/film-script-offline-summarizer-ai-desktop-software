FADE IN:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Rain patters against the window. DETECTIVE JANE MORGAN (35), sharp-eyed and determined, sits at her cluttered desk reviewing case files. Empty coffee cups and takeout containers tell the story of long nights.

Her phone RINGS.

JANE
Morgan.

VOICE (V.O.)
(distorted)
Stop looking into the Henderson case, or you'll regret it.

JANE
Who is this?

The line goes dead. Jane stares at the phone, then at the Henderson file on her desk.

JANE
(to herself)
Now I'm definitely not stopping.

She opens the file, revealing photos of a missing person case. MICHAEL HENDERSON (28), a young accountant who disappeared three weeks ago.

JANE
(voice-over)
In this business, threats usually mean you're getting close to something. The question is: close to what?

Jane picks up her coat and heads for the door.

JANE
(to herself)
Time to pay Mrs. Henderson another visit.

FADE OUT.
